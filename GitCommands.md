# Git Cheat Sheet

1. Config- Allows you to change settings such as your name and email for your user account, along with other settings.
2. Clone- Creates a copy of a repository from Github to a new directory accessible through the home directory.
3. Remote- Shows which remote serveers have been configured to use. -v or -verbose will show the full url for the server that the repo came from.
4. Status- Shows if any of the files that are being tracked have changed since the last commit. 
5. Commit- Adds any changes to the local repository, but will not store them on the central repo. 
6. Push- Pushes changes committed from the local repo to the central one
7. Pull- Copies any changes that have been made on the server to your local repo
8. Add- Adds a file to the list of those that are tracked when the status command is used. It will also add the new file to those that will be committed the next time the commit command is called.


Pull if you need to add new changes, then add files to queue to commit, then commit with message, then push. 

To access repo, open the directory through terminal you want to put repo into.
Run git clone https://github.com/4041ProjectJakeNathan/Project
